## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I have to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

I have used app.js file in js directory for that, making some animation on the page using many functions to convert the page to a dynamic one 

first => I put a list of links in the navigation bar according to the number of sections.

second => I make each link redirect to the section refers to it with changing the link color to make it specific.

Third => I make the navigation bar appear and disappear according to the scrollbar movement.

Forth => I have added a button to redirect to the top of the page which apears only if the user scroll down

Last => I have added a function that highlight the active section in the page.
